							<h3><img src="images/icon1.png">Season <span>7</span></h3>
							<p>Season 5 of Game of Thrones was commissioned by HBO on 8 April 2014, following a substantial increase in audience figures between the third and fourth seasons. The fifth and sixth seasons were commissioned simultaneously, the first time HBO has commissioned two seasons at once for a major drama series. Three episodes shorter than the previous runs, the seventh season solved the show's annual how to top last year's massive episode nine problem by simply not having one. Genius.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>Figuratively though, there was an episode nine in season seven. It was episode 4, "The Spoils Of War." And episode 6 "Beyond The Wall." And a little bit episode 7 "The Dragon And The Wolf." The point being that the battle spectacle and dragon-based fireworks were spread out over seven episodes featuring reunions between long-separated characters, the reappearance of old faces, and newly forged alliances.</p>
							<br>
							<p><b>The cliff-hanger ending saw the Night King, riding zombie-Viserion to Eastwatch (being guarded by Tormund and the Wildlings), where the undead dragon destroyed part of the Wall allowing the undead army to cross South. The fates of Tormund and visitor Beric Dondarrion were left hanging in the balance. As were the fates of everybody else."
