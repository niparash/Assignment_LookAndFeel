							This page contains information related to project submission. It does not have anything to the content of the website.
							</p>
							<br>
							<h3>Responsiveness</h3>
							<p>
							A website that is being accessed on desktop-screen by a user is expected to be compatible or work gracefully on other devices, too. In order to make the website compatible on varied screen-sizes, entended part of the class and attributes in HTML and CSS are written. These blocks of code are written in CSS file that are being pulled and pushed to HTML before and after enhancements, respectively.
							</p>
							<br>
							<h3>Usability</h3>
							<p>
							The website is designed considering ease-of-use for the end-user. Nagigation bar with all the links is present on all the pages making the navigation as smooth and convinient as possible. For showing the best quotes of the series on which website is built, auto-mode is preferred implying that the user does not need to scroll through them; although, the provision of scrolling/navigating to other quotes horizontally is being provided. Hence, it is upto the user, which mode do they want to utilize.
							</p>
							<br>
							<h3>Content</h3>
							<p>
							The website contains information about Game of Thrones, George R.R. Martin's best-selling book series "A Song of Ice and Fire" is brought to the screen as HBO sinks its considerable storytelling teeth into the medieval fantasy epic. It's the depiction of two powerful families -- kings and queens, knights and renegades, liars and honest men -- playing a deadly game for control of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, and to sit atop the Iron Throne. Martin is credited as a co-executive producer and one of the writers for the series, whose shooting locations include Northern Ireland, Malta, Croatia and Spain.
							</p>
							<p>
							It starts with homepage (of course!) that gives general and basic information about series encapsulated with some of its best quotes. The Synopsis tab contains a brief overview of season 7 (latest season aired in 2017). GoT Family tab contains information about three main families arounnd whom the story revolves. You are currently on the About page, giving information about our group project. Git Hub tab navigates user to the project on GitHub giving access to our code.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
							So, this website would be a good reference for a person who is unaware (making the person drive towards it) and for the one who is aware (rejoicing the nostalgia).
							</p>
							<br>
							<h3>Design</h3>
							<p>
							In this Game of Thrones website, we implemented style tiles. People who watch Game of Thrones are interested in the families and the characters associated with them, so we grouped the characters by their families in one of the web pages, so that the users can get to know the relationships between characters better. And this design style can encourage the users to explore the website in a better way. 
<br>                                                        
We built a robust content audit for the website, all the contents in the website are formatted, if we want to change something on the website, we just need to change the specific content, so it becomes very easy for us to modify or expand the website in the whole development process. 
<br>
                                                        We created an Information Architecture (IA) diagram before building the website, it’s very helpful for us in mastering which content should appear on which part of the website, making the website more sensible.

<h3>Self Reflection</h3>
<p>
Nikky Parashar- Used HTML and CSS after a very long time and was a very good experience working again with these familiar technologies commonly used for web page designing.
<br>
Karan Gupta- It was a good hands-on excercise working with HTML and CSS only for making static web pages without using any other technology like javascript or jquery. Got familiar with HTML and CSS scripting. 
<br>
Yuxuan Cen- Used CSS for the first time in designing the web pages and was a very good experience working with this technology as I got to learn new things and will often use this technology in upcoming projects.
